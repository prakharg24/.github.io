**Abstract** : The Next Generation Sequencing Technique (NGS) has provided an affordable and fast method for sequencing genetic data. However, generation of whole genome sequences and extraction of relevant information from this data is still a time consuming and computationally expensive process. With the increasing size of database in genomics everyday, we need to create tools that can provide faster processing. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel approach to encode DNA sequences using skipgram model. Our method is capable of successfully compressing the input feature size, while retaining comparative information required for further processing. We test our encoding method by performing pseudo local alignment of DNA reads with respect to a reference genome. We are able to significantly improve the speed of alignment, while achieving competitive accuracy. We provide extensive experimentation as well theoretical insights into the performance of our method, and compare it with industry standards like BWA-MEM and BLAST.

The project was done under ASSITECH Lab, Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi. We created a learning assistant for visually challenged, comprising of an Android App for real-time finger gestures and movement detection and a Desktop IDE for automated data generation and mapping this data to vector images. Live demo for visually challenged was presented in IITD OpenHouse 2017.

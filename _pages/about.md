Hi! Iâ€™m Prakhar. I recently graduated from [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}, with a Masters of Computing (AI specialization) under [Prof. Reza Shokri](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I did my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} and worked at [Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore](https://adsc.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a Research Engineer for two years. My research interests involve studying the challenges that arise in machine learning when moving from the sandbox to the real world, including fairness, privacy, adversarial robustness, compression, etc., by uncovering the learning dynamics of neural models. My long term goal is a career in research and academia in the field of AI.

I'm starting my PhD under [Prof Golnoosh Farnadi](https://gfarnadi.github.io/) at [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) from September 2023!

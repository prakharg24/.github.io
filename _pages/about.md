Hi! Iâ€™m Prakhar. I'm currently working as Research Engineer at [Advanced Digital Sciences Center](https://adsc.illinois.edu/), Singapore. I did my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/). **I will be joining Masters of Computing (AI specialization) at [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) this coming August.** My research interests involve an investigative study of learning models through explainability, interpretability, robustness, compression, vulnerability, etc., in an attempt to decode the reasoning behind complex architecture designs. I like to explore the reasoning behind how neural networks behave. My long term goal is a career in research and academia in the field of AI.

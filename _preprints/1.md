title: "Nucl2Vec : Local alignment of DNA sequences using Distributed Vector Representation"
collection: preprints
permalink: /preprints/1
excerpt: 'The Next Generation Sequencing Technique (NGS) has provided affordable and fast method for generating genetic data. Generation of whole Genome Sequence and extract relevant information from this data is still a computationally expensive process. In this paper we demonstrate a novel approach for local alignment of DNA reads with respect to reference genome. For this process we have used Skip-gram model for creating encoding(Nucl2Vec) and k-nearest neighbor for the alignment. With our new approach we have reduced computation cost for local alignment, while achieving accuracy comparable to existing defacto standard BWA-MEM tool.'
